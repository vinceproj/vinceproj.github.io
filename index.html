    <h1>Hi I'm Vince</h1>
    <p class="body">
      My name is Vince and I am a super senior at Cal State Fullerton. I am
      currently an unemployed, full time student finishing up my Comp Sci degree
      in Fall 2019. I have also worked as a cook, store manager, IT intern, and
      coding teacher to kids. When I catch a free moment I tend to binge videos,
      play some games, and help keep a discord server from collapsing.
