        <p>
          In 2013, I committed Asian American treason and withdrew from the
          University of California, Irvine to instead attend California State
          University, Fullerton. Transferring universities this way had been
          considered a backwards step by many. This move meant I would be
          leaving behind a prestigious university, temporarily switching from
          devoted scholar to dropout, and wasting away years of my previous
          efforts. Fortunately, this move actually meant giving myself the
          opportunity to finally explore what I wanted for myself and how I
          wanted to get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the coming years, I managed to work myself towards financial
          independence, independent living, and into a Computer Science
          program. I had the opportunities to work as a store manager, data
          processing operator, IT intern, and a "role model" (instructor) all
          while progressing through courses. These experiences gave me unique
          opportunities to grow my skill set as well as myself as a person. In
          Fall of 2019, I finished my final courses and am looking forward to
          continuing my trend of pursuing opportunity to have a life I can be
          excited for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of what the future may bring, I plan on bringing myself
          up to the challenge as best I can. I will continue to learn and grow
          both as a working professional and as a person. Thank you for taking
          the time to read my About Me and I wish you all the best. Cheers!

          May 2016 - May 2017 <br><br>
          A management position at a small food business located in Brea, CA.
          I worked alongside the business owner to help develop the business
          in terms of forward direction and quality of product. At various
          times, I assumed full control of operations in the absence of the
          owner.<br /><br />
          Working here allowed me to have a hands on experience with operating
          a business. I thoroughly enjoyed the demanding environment and the
          leadership role handed to me. The hours I spent working with the
          owner and staff to keep the business functioning are a memory I hold
          dearly.

          January 2018 - June 2018 <br><br>
          A full time job spent at a medical document auditing office in
          Anaheim. My time here gave me the opportunity to work with various
          medical agencies and their chosen web environments to help process
          medical documents. I also worked alongside upper management to help
          develop a Quality Assurance team to review the work of our Data
          Processing department.<br /><br />

          The responsibilities given to me during my time here allowed me to
          develop various aspects of my communication skills while working
          with both my peers and agency representatives. It was a gratifying
          experience in a unique field.

          June 2018 - August 2018 <br> <br>
          A summer internship working alongside the Service Desk at Belkin's
          corporate headquarters in Playa Vista. The experience gave me an
          opportunity to work with both front-end and back-end technology,
          especially in terms of how deployment would be handled and its
          possible effects on our users.<br /><br />

          Luckily enough, my time here matched the Belkin-FIT merger. This
          gave me the opportunity to observe the company in a very dynamic
          moment, and as part of the IT team I managed to learn quite a bit as
          I worked alongside our users. This opportunity helped me develop a
          greater understanding and appreciation for the functions and culture
          of a global business.

          personal development by venturing into an unexpected opportunity.

          ColorSpot is a small Unity game developed during a semester long course. I served as project manager, design
          lead, and head artist for this project.
          This workload allowed me to explore my creative freedoms with the game, but it did leave me unable to assist
          with actual Unity code development.
          A majority of my time went towards managing team progress, developing wireframes, creating the basis of the
          game, and creating all of the art assets.<br><br>
          The experience allowed me to apply knowledge I gained from powering through a multitude of online learning
          courses. I am very thankful to have had such an amazing
          team to work with during the entirety of the semester. <br><br>

          This project is a Turing Machine version of the Game of Life. It is designed to take single step movements to
          create progression through the Game of Life. The code offers the ability to view the Turing Machine do every
          step-by-step calculation or to have each Game of Life turn to be displayed instead. This project heavily
          relied on translating basic computations into a workable game. <br><br>
          Creating this project was an interesting experience in terms of having to design game code to match the
          limitations of a Turing Machine. I will never forget my professor's adamant admissions of a Turing Machine
          being as powerful as any other computer possible. <br><br>
