    <h1>Why I am Here</h1>
    <p>
      I enrolled in this course to create a foundation for my interest in web
      design. I have always enjoyed designing and being able to apply
      functionality to design. Learning front-end engineering lets me explore
      both my enjoyment for the arts and technical sciences.

      I have minor experience in web development. I know as much as a couple
      online tutorials could teach, but I learned from them quite casually. I
      would say I have a decent starting point to start from but definitely need
      to continue learning. I am hoping to learn enough from the course to make
      any future self-learning feel sensible and intuitive.
